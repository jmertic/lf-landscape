# Linux Foundation Landscape

![LF Landscape Logo](https://landscape.linuxfoundation.org/images/left-logo.svg)

This landscape is intended as a map to explore open source projects hosted by the Linux Foundation and also shows its member companies. It is modeled after the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) [landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io) and based on the same open-source code.

This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the [CNCF landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io). The software that generates it can be found at the [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2) repository. Please see its [README file](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2#landscape2) for more information about how it works.

## New Entries and Corrections

All the data in this repository is built nightly using the [LFX Landscape Tools](https://github.com/jmertic/lfx-landscape-tools). Any changes made directly in the data files in this repository will be overwritten.

- For member entries, you can make these changes in [LFX Organization Dashboard](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/organization-dashboard/organization-profile).
- For project entries, those changes can be made in [LFX Project Control Center (PCC)](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center/v2-latest-version/operations/project-definition).

If you cannot access the above resources, please [create a helpdesk ticket](https://members.linuxfoundation.org) to request those changes.

## Local Build and Install

You can build the landscape locally on your machine using the (landscape2)[https://github.com/cncf/landscape2] tool. Once [installed](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), you can use the commands below to build the landscape and serve it locally.

```shell
landscape2 build --data-file landscape.yml --settings-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/landscape2-sites/refs/heads/main/lf/settings.yml --logos-path hosted_logos --output-dir build
landscape2 serve --landscape-dir build
```
