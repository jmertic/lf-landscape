              Aeraki Mesh allows you to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.
              While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure for microservices, many service mesh implementations mainly focus on HTTP protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. This makes it very hard for users to manage the traffic of other widely-used layer-7 protocols in microservices. For example, in a microservices application, we usually have the below protocols:
                * RPC: HTTP, gRPC, Thrift, Dubbo, Proprietary RPC Protocol …
                * Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ …
                * Cache: Redis, Memcached …
                * Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB …
              HTTP is just a part of the problem we need to solve. Aeraki Mesh is created to provide a non-intrusive, highly extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.

              Aeraki Mesh is an open source project backed by Tencent Cloud (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tencent-cloud),  contributed and used by a number of companies/projects inside and outside of Tencent, suh QQ music, Yangshiping, Yonghui Super Marke, etc. (https://www.aeraki.net/). Tencent Cloud  is committed to continue working on Aeraki Mesh going forward, and plans to provide managed Aeraki Mesh service on the cloud.

              Since eBPF is gaining in popularity, we are building tools that make it easier for developers and operations teams to securely deploy and manage eBPF programs in various environments.

              bpfman is a suite of eBPF program management tooling that includes:
                - A system service for loading and managing eBPF programs
                - An opentelemetry metrics exporter for the kernel eBPF subsystem
                - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and a Kubernetes Controller that extend our loading and management capabilities to Kubernetes.
                - A Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin that can provision BPF filesystems.

              This suite is available as binaries or RPMs for Linux, and packaged as an Operator for Kubernetes.

              Carina is a cloud native storage system which conforms standard Kubernetes CSI spec and  provides raw disk performance for stateful applications and has ops-free maintaining. The core function of Carina is grouping local disks of each node and provides LVM or RAW disks via different storage classes. For each PVC, Carina tries to find the most suitable node to setup data volume. Carina also has lots of useful features, for example:

              * device registration
              * PVC resizing
              * IO throttling
              * volume topology
              * PVC auto-tiering
              * pod failover to other nodes
              * RAID management
              * SMART-aware PVC

              Besides of rich functionalities, Carina also is an ops-free CSI, for example:

              * Installation by yaml or helm. No dependencies for each node.
              * Using battle-tested kernel modules and sits beside of the core IO path. 
              * If disk fails, just plugin a new one and that's done."

              "External Secrets Operator (ESO) is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Google Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault and many more. The operator reads information from external APIs and automatically injects the values into a Kubernetes Secret.

              ESO provides a user-friendly abstraction for the external API that stores the secrets for you. It allows you to manage access to the secret store for different tenants within your cluster and keeps the Kubernetes secrets in sync.

              Grid eXchange Fabric (GXF) is a software platform that enables hardware monitoring and control in the public space. GXF provides several functions out of the box and provides scalability & high availability, high security, a generic design, and no vendor lock-in. GXF is currently deployed in several public use cases, including microgrids, smart metering, public lighting, and distribution automation.

              GXF is open, independent, and driven by its community, developed using open source best practices and designed to use open standards. This enables third parties to develop new and innovative solutions. The trade-off is flexibility and freedom. Unlike closed proprietary software, open source software can be altered and extended by any developer familiar with the source code. This grants organizations freedom from “vendor lock-in,” assures long-term viability, and creates industry opportunities for support, consulting, and training.

              KEDA is a Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaler. KEDA determines how any container in Kubernetes should be scaled based on the number of events that need to be processed.

              KEDA is a single-purpose and lightweight component that can be added to any Kubernetes cluster. It works alongside standard Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and can extend functionality without overwriting or duplication. With KEDA you can specify the that apps you want to scale in an event-driven way while other apps continue to function. This makes KEDA a flexible and safe option to run alongside other Kubernetes applications and frameworks.

              Kepler is a lightweight Pod level power consumption metrics exporter.

              Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter) uses eBPF to probe CPU performance counters and Linux kernel tracepoints. These data and stats from cgroup and sysfs are fed into ML models to estimate power consumption by Pods. The power consumption stats are then presented as Prometheus metrics and telemetry that can be used for Pod scheduling or scaling, energy consumption reporting and visulization, or can be extended with carbon intensity metrics to report on carbon footprint of Cloud Native workload.

              The Konveyor Project is an open community of tools for modernization to Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.  These tools may be used either together or individually, depending on the needs of the migration team. The tools within the community provide the ability to:
              1. Assess and analyze applications to determine which modernization strategy to utilize (rehost, replatform, or refactor). 
              2. Automate the rehosting, replatforming, and refactoring of applications.
              3. Measure the impact of modernization on software delivery performance.

              Kubescape is an open-source tool for testing if Kubernetes is deployed securely according to multiple frameworks: regulatory, customized company policies and DevSecOps best practices, such as the NSA-CISA hardening guidance and the MITRE ATT&CK® .

              Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, and detect misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline and provides a risk score instantly and risk trends over time. Kubescape integrates natively with other DevOps tools, including Jenkins, CircleCI and Github workflows. Kubescape policies are based on Open Policy Agent and the REGO language. 

              A key idea behind Kubescape it to put security capabilities at the hands of the Developers and the DevOps teams. Our vision is to create a wide open-source Kubernetes security project with capabilities that will span across configuration control, vulnerabilities, RBAC management and runtime security - all made for developers and DevOps to add to their tools in a native way.

Policy authors are now empowered to write Kubernetes policies using their favourite programming languages as long as they can be compiled to WebAssembly. With support for Rego built-ins, they can also leverage and reuse existing Open Policy Agent or Gatekeeper policies for securing their Kubernetes clusters. 

              Policies are distributed using regular container registries and can be signed and verified using Sigstore.

              "Merbridge is a fully open-sourced cloud-native project to accelerate popular service meshes such as Istio, Linkerd, and Kuma by replacing iptables rules with eBPF, which allows transporting data directly from inbound sockets to outbound sockets, effectively shortening the datapath between sidecars and services.
              Merbridge uses eBPF to intercept outbound and inbound traffic and provides a feedback mechanism to enable eBPF to get the IP address of current namespace and redirect the Envoy connection to a pre-defined port. After applying Merbridge, the outbound/inbound traffic can skip many filter steps to effectively improve network performance.
              With Merbridge, developers can use eBPF to accelerate the Mesh without any additional operations or code changes."

              The Open Policy Registry (OPCR) project contains a CLI (policy) for building, tagging, pushing, and pulling OPA policies as OCIv2 images. The policy CLI defaults to pushing and pulling from opcr.io, a free hosted registry that is optimized around listing and handling policy images. With that said, the policy CLI works with any OCIv2-compatible registry, such as GitHub Container Registry, Google Artifact Registry, AWS Container Registry, etc. 

              The ecosystem benefits of using the policy CLI are that policies can now be built into immutable images, signed using cosign, and pushed and pulled from container registries - in other words, the benefits of the OCIv2 ecosystem are now conferred to OPA policies.

              The policy CLI workflow is modeled after the docker CLI - with the ability to build images locally (""policy build""), tag them (""policy tag""), list them (""policy images""), pull them (""policy pull""), and push them (""policy push""). This brings the familiar workflow to the OPA policies.

              Paralus offers access management for developers, architects, and CI/CD tools to remote K8s clusters by consolidating zero-trust access principles such as transaction level authentication and authorization into a single open-source tool. It helps engineering and architecture teams streamline access control for their fleet of K8s clusters spanning different operating environments, different public clouds and K8s distributions, and on-premises data centers operating behind firewalls.
              ​​
              Paralus grants authorized users seamless and secure access to all clusters with a native and familiar kubectl experience by acting as a proxy between the users and systems needing access and the K8s API server. It also addresses one of K8s’ main pain points by eliminating the burden of managing K8s access controls cluster by cluster. Without Paralus, companies must manually manage access to each cluster using jump hosts or VPNs, and build custom tooling to audit and map all actions performed to a user’s identity – all of which is error-prone and increases the risk of breaches as the number of clusters grows.


              Along with helping directly manage role-based access control (RBAC) policies and assignments, Paralus enables:

              - Creation of custom roles, users, and groups.
              - Custom user role creation and revoking of permissions.
              - Ability to control access via pre-configured roles across clusters, namespaces, projects, and more.
              - Seamless integration with Identity Providers (IdPs) allowing the use of external authentication engines for users and group definitions, such as GitHub, Google, Azure AD, Okta, and others.
              - Automatic logging of all user actions performed for audit and compliance purposes.
              - Interact with Paralus either with a modern web GUI (default), a CLI tool called pctl, or Paralus API.

              PipeCD is a GitOps-style continuous delivery platform that provides consistent deployment and operations experience for any application.

              The idea of PipeCD is to make a unified interface to deploy different kinds of applications (currently PipeCD supports Kubernetes, Terraform, GCP Cloud Run, AWS Lambda, and AWS ECS). The reason behind that idea is we are faced with systems that mix multiple platforms running applications, and also at the company scale, not every team has the same idea/experience/taste when choosing the team stack (CD included), and all gaps and diversity between teams’ decisions should be respected and treated carefully.

It uses static and dynamic container analysis to understand the containerized application and what it needs to run, so it can generate the smallest possible container images. The lesser known capabilities include the xray command used to inspect container images and the debug command used to debug minimal container images by attaching a debugging container to the target container.

              The z/OS Open Tools github organization serves as a collaborative github organization for z/OS UNIX developers, users, and organizations who contribute to and utilize open-source tools on z/OS.
              z/OS Open Tools started in 2022 with a handful of projects and now currently hosts over 180+ projects, with the aim of providing the build recipes as well as the patches to enable popular open source packages to build and run on z/OS. z/OS Open Tools includes ports for popular open source projects like Git, Bash, Curl, CMake, Make, GPG, LLama.cpp, Vim, Nano and many more.
              z/OS Open Tools also distributes binaries for each of the tools as Github releases. It also provides a z/OS UNIX package manager (zopen) that makes it easy to consume the 180+ tools directly on z/OS.
