              Aeraki Mesh allows you to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.
              While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure for microservices, many service mesh implementations mainly focus on HTTP protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. This makes it very hard for users to manage the traffic of other widely-used layer-7 protocols in microservices. For example, in a microservices application, we usually have the below protocols:
                * RPC: HTTP, gRPC, Thrift, Dubbo, Proprietary RPC Protocol …
                * Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ …
                * Cache: Redis, Memcached …
                * Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB …
              HTTP is just a part of the problem we need to solve. Aeraki Mesh is created to provide a non-intrusive, highly extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.

              Aeraki Mesh is an open source project backed by Tencent Cloud (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tencent-cloud),  contributed and used by a number of companies/projects inside and outside of Tencent, suh QQ music, Yangshiping, Yonghui Super Marke, etc. (https://www.aeraki.net/). Tencent Cloud  is committed to continue working on Aeraki Mesh going forward, and plans to provide managed Aeraki Mesh service on the cloud.

              An operator simply applies an Akri Configuration to a cluster, specifying the Discovery Handler (most commonly a protocol) that should be used to discover the devices, and the pod that should be deployed upon discovery. Then Akri does the rest.

              An operator can also allow multiple nodes to use an IoT device, thereby providing high availability in the case where a node goes offline. Furthermore, Akri will automatically create a Kubernetes service for each type of device, removing the need for an application to track the state of pods or nodes."

            description: The ability to monitor the Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI) where VNFs are in operation will be a key part of Service Assurance within an NFV environment, in order to enforce SLAs or to detect violations, faults or degradation in the performance of NFVI resources so that events and relevant metrics are reported to higher level fault management systems. If fixed function appliances are going to be replaced by virtualized appliances the service levels, manageability and service assurance needs to remain consistent or improve on what is available today.

              Since eBPF is gaining in popularity, we are building tools that make it easier for developers and operations teams to securely deploy and manage eBPF programs in various environments.

              bpfman is a suite of eBPF program management tooling that includes:
                - A system service for loading and managing eBPF programs
                - An opentelemetry metrics exporter for the kernel eBPF subsystem
                - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and a Kubernetes Controller that extend our loading and management capabilities to Kubernetes.
                - A Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin that can provision BPF filesystems.

              This suite is available as binaries or RPMs for Linux, and packaged as an Operator for Kubernetes.

              Carina is a cloud native storage system which conforms standard Kubernetes CSI spec and  provides raw disk performance for stateful applications and has ops-free maintaining. The core function of Carina is grouping local disks of each node and provides LVM or RAW disks via different storage classes. For each PVC, Carina tries to find the most suitable node to setup data volume. Carina also has lots of useful features, for example:

              * device registration
              * PVC resizing
              * IO throttling
              * volume topology
              * PVC auto-tiering
              * pod failover to other nodes
              * RAID management
              * SMART-aware PVC

              Besides of rich functionalities, Carina also is an ops-free CSI, for example:

Data access becomes independent from location, application and storage, enabling in-network caching and and anchor-less mobility. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. These concepts are known under different terms, including but not limited to: Content-Centric Networking (CCN), Named Data Networking (NDN), the network of information (Netinf) and Publish/Subscribe Networking (PSIRP).'

              Clusterpedia can synchronize resources with multiple clusters and provide more powerful search features on the basis of compatibility with Kubernetes OpenAPI to help you effectively get any multi-cluster resource that you are looking for in a quick and easy way.

              And it already supports the synchronization and search for custom resources.

              Work with relevant projects in OPNFV, including installer projects, testing projects, infrastructure projects, to integrate, deploy and test RIs as part of OPNFV release life-cycle.
              Implement a limited number of RIs that address CNTT reference architectures to meet operators’ requirements. Limit the number of RI to ensure limiting the VNF verification effort
              Develop test-cases for testing RI.  These test cases could be used by the compliance program for verification and compliance.
              Work with LF Compliance and Verification Committee (CVC) to integrate RI, test cases and test frameworks within OVP compliance Framework.

              Device Automation Bus is a simple protocol for intuitively interacting with consumer electronics in the living room that are connected to the Internet such as Smart TVs and gaming consoles. DAB enables device manufacturers and application developers to programmatically start and stop applications, send key presses to the device, restart the device, capture device metrics among other operations. Using DAB, device manufacturers and application developers can automate manual tasks such as application compatibility
              checks, cross application performance testing and monitoring device memory usage. Automating manual tasks provides reliable results and saves time and money.

It handles attestation and delivery into a run-time “Keep” based on WebAssembly, offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation. Enarx is CPU-architecture independent, enabling the same application code to be deployed across multiple targets, abstracting issues such as cross-compilation and differing attestation mechanisms between hardware vendors. Work is currently underway on AMD SEV and Intel SGX.

              Organizations joining the EUDI Wallet ecosystem face a tough choice: patch together protocol libraries that may not exist for their stack, or rely on proprietary solutions that risk vendor lock-in.

              EUDIPLO solves this by providing a lightweight, source-available, protocol abstraction layer. It communicates over HTTP and integrates easily with your existing backend stack—so you can focus on your business logic, not cryptographic plumbing.

              It supports all core flows of electronic attribute attestations—issuing, requesting, and even requesting during issuance—and is already compatible with production-grade EUDI Wallets like Animo.

              While still in early development, EUDIPLO is built for production: secure key management, scalable database support, and clean API boundaries.

            description: GeoDa is the flagship program of the GeoDa Center, following a long line of software tools developed by Dr. Luc Anselin. It is designed to implement techniques for exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) on lattice data (points and polygons). The free program provides a user friendly and graphical interface to methods of descriptive spatial data analysis, such as spatial autocorrelation statistics, as well as basic spatial regression functionality. The latest version contains several new features such as full space-time data support in all views, a new cartogram, a refined map movie, parallel coordinate plot, 3D visualization, conditional plots (and maps) and spatial regression.

              Hyperlight is a library for creating micro virtual machines — or sandboxes — specifically optimized for securely running untrusted code with minimal impact. It supports both Windows and Linux, utilizing Windows Hypervisor Platform on Windows, and either Microsoft Hypervisor (mshv) or KVM on Linux.

              These micro VMs operate without a kernel or operating system, keeping overhead low. Instead, guests are built specifically for Hyperlight using the Hyperlight Guest library, which provides a controlled set of APIs that facilitate interaction between host and guest:

              The host can call functions implemented and exposed by the guest (known as guest functions).
              Once running, the guest can call functions implemented and exposed by the host (known as host functions).
              By default, Hyperlight restricts guest access to a minimal API. The only host function available by default allows the guest to print messages, which are displayed on the host console or redirected to stdout, as configured. Hosts can choose to expose additional host functions, expanding the guest’s capabilities as needed.

              Virtual Kubelets are a powerful resource when it comes to exploit computing capacity managed outside of a Kubernetes cluster (possibly in a remote center). Although the current interface allows to create any number of custom implementations, it requires knowledge of the kubernetes internals.

              interLink proposes a twofold model with clear roles and responsibilities. On the one hand a core component that interact through the Virtual Kubelet interface with the Kubernetes cluster, on the other hand a stateless plugin based architecture respecting the interLink OpenAPI specification. The latter is delegated to implement any pod execution details and interact with target resources. Plugins grant the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed system but most importantly they allow to hide the k8s interface complexity. Indeed, resource owners can build or customize plugins to define how a payload should be executed on their resources without any k8s knowledge.

Kubernetes, originally designed to manage and orchestrate containerized applications and microservices, has significantly expanded its reach through its inherent API extensibility, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of use cases entirely outside the realm of containers. IronCore takes a modern spin with Kubernetes, offering a single interface for managing resources orchestrated across regions, data centers, and availability zones. All assembled with the identical blueprint, thereby offering unmatched flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Unlike traditional infrastructure solutions, IronCore delivers a much sought, fresh, next generation approach. As a default, Ceph is modularly provided as a cloud-natively automated, vendor-neutral storage backend for block, shared, and object storage. Furthermore, a disruptive network fabric based on CLOS Topology is included. The software defined network data plane materializes through routed layer 3 only, using an IPv6 overlay, and is grounded on the robust, standard experience of the established internet architecture and technology.

              KEDA is a Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaler. KEDA determines how any container in Kubernetes should be scaled based on the number of events that need to be processed.

              KEDA is a single-purpose and lightweight component that can be added to any Kubernetes cluster. It works alongside standard Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and can extend functionality without overwriting or duplication. With KEDA you can specify the that apps you want to scale in an event-driven way while other apps continue to function. This makes KEDA a flexible and safe option to run alongside other Kubernetes applications and frameworks.

              Kepler is a lightweight Pod level power consumption metrics exporter.

              Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter) uses eBPF to probe CPU performance counters and Linux kernel tracepoints. These data and stats from cgroup and sysfs are fed into ML models to estimate power consumption by Pods. The power consumption stats are then presented as Prometheus metrics and telemetry that can be used for Pod scheduling or scaling, energy consumption reporting and visulization, or can be extended with carbon intensity metrics to report on carbon footprint of Cloud Native workload.

            description: ko is a simple, fast container image builder for Go applications. It's ideal for use cases where the image contains a single Go application without many dependencies on the OS base image (e.g. no cgo or OS package dependencies). ko builds images by effectively executing go build on a local machine, and as such doesn't require docker. ko is also a good fit for lightweight CI/CD use cases given its multi-platform support and automatic SBOM generation capabilities.

              Kubescape is an open-source tool for testing if Kubernetes is deployed securely according to multiple frameworks: regulatory, customized company policies and DevSecOps best practices, such as the NSA-CISA hardening guidance and the MITRE ATT&CK® .

              Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, and detect misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline and provides a risk score instantly and risk trends over time. Kubescape integrates natively with other DevOps tools, including Jenkins, CircleCI and Github workflows. Kubescape policies are based on Open Policy Agent and the REGO language. 

              A key idea behind Kubescape it to put security capabilities at the hands of the Developers and the DevOps teams. Our vision is to create a wide open-source Kubernetes security project with capabilities that will span across configuration control, vulnerabilities, RBAC management and runtime security - all made for developers and DevOps to add to their tools in a native way.

              Kubewarden is a Kubernetes Policy Engine which leverages WebAssembly to define, distribute and run its policies. Policy authors are now empowered to write Kubernetes policies using their favourite programming languages as long as they can be compiled to WebAssembly. With support for Rego built-ins, they can also leverage and reuse existing Open Policy Agent or Gatekeeper policies for securing their Kubernetes clusters. 

              Policies are distributed using regular container registries and can be signed and verified using Sigstore.

              OpenCost is an open source cost allocation model that provides visibility into current and historical Kubernetes workload spend and resource consumption. This provides cost transparency in containerized environments with multiple tenants and allows teams to view costs across all aggregation-levels, including namespace, label, and controller all the way down to the individual pod and container. Organizations can provide unified cost monitoring, showback, real-time alerting, chargeback and more across projects and teams with this visibility. This project is the core engine for Kubecost, which is used by thousands of enterprises to monitor billions of total spend in environments with 10,000+ nodes.

              - Summary of features enabled by this cost model:
              - Real-time cost allocation by Kubernetes service, deployment, namespace, label, statefulset, daemonset, pod, and container
              - Dynamic asset pricing enabled by integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP billing APIs
              - Supports on-prem k8s clusters with custom pricing sheets
              - Allocation for in-cluster resources like CPU, GPU, memory, load balancers, network costs, and persistent volumes.
              - Easily export pricing data to Prometheus and Alertmanager (learn more)

              Open Crypto Broker (OCB) introduces an abstraction layer where cryptographic operations are defined through configurable profiles rather than being hardcoded into applications. Instead of applications handling their own cryptographic functions, they can rely on OCB to manage these tasks. This separation of concerns enables organizations to meet new security requirements, such as compliance with FIPS 140 or the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography, without needing to modify the underlying applications.

            description: Open Path Guiding Library (OpenPGL) is an open-source library, that improves the rendering efficiency of a renderer by providing easy to integrate and production-ready implementations of state-of-the-art path guiding algorithms. Especially in challenging illumination setups (complex indirect illumination, volumetric multi scattering) these algorithms significantly improve rendering performance.

              Stop using a different policy language, policy model, and policy API for every product and service you use. Use OPA for a unified toolset and framework for policy across the cloud native stack.

              Whether for one service or for all your services, use OPA to decouple policy from the service's code so you can release, analyze, and review policies (which security and compliance teams love) without sacrificing availability or performance.

              The Open Policy Registry (OPCR) project contains a CLI (policy) for building, tagging, pushing, and pulling OPA policies as OCIv2 images. The policy CLI defaults to pushing and pulling from opcr.io, a free hosted registry that is optimized around listing and handling policy images. With that said, the policy CLI works with any OCIv2-compatible registry, such as GitHub Container Registry, Google Artifact Registry, AWS Container Registry, etc. 

              The ecosystem benefits of using the policy CLI are that policies can now be built into immutable images, signed using cosign, and pushed and pulled from container registries - in other words, the benefits of the OCIv2 ecosystem are now conferred to OPA policies.

              The policy CLI workflow is modeled after the docker CLI - with the ability to build images locally (""policy build""), tag them (""policy tag""), list them (""policy images""), pull them (""policy pull""), and push them (""policy push""). This brings the familiar workflow to the OPA policies.

            description: |-
              Paralus offers access management for developers, architects, and CI/CD tools to remote K8s clusters by consolidating zero-trust access principles such as transaction level authentication and authorization into a single open-source tool. It helps engineering and architecture teams streamline access control for their fleet of K8s clusters spanning different operating environments, different public clouds and K8s distributions, and on-premises data centers operating behind firewalls.
              ​​
              Paralus grants authorized users seamless and secure access to all clusters with a native and familiar kubectl experience by acting as a proxy between the users and systems needing access and the K8s API server. It also addresses one of K8s’ main pain points by eliminating the burden of managing K8s access controls cluster by cluster. Without Paralus, companies must manually manage access to each cluster using jump hosts or VPNs, and build custom tooling to audit and map all actions performed to a user’s identity – all of which is error-prone and increases the risk of breaches as the number of clusters grows.


              Along with helping directly manage role-based access control (RBAC) policies and assignments, Paralus enables:

              - Creation of custom roles, users, and groups.
              - Custom user role creation and revoking of permissions.
              - Ability to control access via pre-configured roles across clusters, namespaces, projects, and more.
              - Seamless integration with Identity Providers (IdPs) allowing the use of external authentication engines for users and group definitions, such as GitHub, Google, Azure AD, Okta, and others.
              - Automatic logging of all user actions performed for audit and compliance purposes.
              - Interact with Paralus either with a modern web GUI (default), a CLI tool called pctl, or Paralus API.

The Pharos Specification defines a "compliant" deployment and test environment. Pharos is responsible for defining lab capabilities, developing management/usage policies and process; and a support plan for reliable access to project and release resources. Community labs are provided as a service by companies and are not controlled by Pharos however our goal is to provide easy visibility of all lab capabilities and their usage at all-times.

The reason behind that idea is we are faced with systems that mix multiple platforms running applications, and also at the company scale, not every team has the same idea/experience/taste when choosing the team stack (CD included), and all gaps and diversity between teams’ decisions should be respected and treated carefully.

            description: Prio is a privacy-respecting system for the collection of aggregate statistics such as application metrics.Applications such as web browsers, mobile applications, or websites generate data. Normally they would just send all of the data back to the application developer, but Prio applications split the data into two anonymized and encrypted shares and upload each share to different data share processors that do not share data with each other. This way only minimal information about the original data is revealed to either processor. Each processor then aggregates its data shares into a partial sum. The partial sums can then be combined into a final aggregation, permitting useful statistics over the whole body of data while revealing minimal information about individual participants.

              SlimToolkit (aka DockerSlim) provides a way to inspect, optimize/slim and debug containers

              SlimToolkit/Slim is best know for its ability to minify container images. It was created during a global Docker hackathon project (as DockerSlim). It uses static and dynamic container analysis to understand the containerized application and what it needs to run, so it can generate the smallest possible container images. The lesser known capabilities include the xray command used to inspect container images and the debug command used to debug minimal container images by attaching a debugging container to the target container.

            description: |-
              The primary goal of urunc is to bridge the gap between unikernels (or similar technologies) and containerized environments, enabling seamless integration with cloud-native architectures. unikernels operate in a fundamentally different execution environment compared to traditional processes and containers. They typically run as VMs or on specialized monitors that facilitate external communication. This inherent difference introduces challenges in orchestration, tooling, and integration with existing cloud platforms. As a result, their adoption in cloud-native ecosystems remains limited.
              urunc addresses this gap by enabling seamless unikernel integration within the cloud-native ecosystem. urunc aligns with container semantics and leverages OCI tooling and methodologies, aiming to be the “runc for unikernels”, while maintaining CRI compatibility

              VCX is an open-source codebase that provides a wide suite of Rust modules for building DID & Aries-related applications (client/mobile and server). VCX is designed with a heavily modularized structure (20+ crates in the workspace) such that consumers can pick-and-choose which components they wish to build their DI application with. Currently, some of the significant modules provided by VCX include:
              * `did_doc`, `did_parser`, `did_resolver` - a set of lightweight libraries which provide well-typed structures and interfaces for DID building, parsing, and resolving. We envision these components becoming defacto libraries for Rust projects involving DIDs.
              * DID Method Crates - several DID method-specific crates for resolving and managing DIDs (peer, cheqd, web, key, jwk, sov/unqualified).
              * `aries_vcx_ledger`, `aries_vcx_wallet`, `aries_vcx_anoncreds` - a set of libraries with interfaces for performing ledger, wallet, and anoncred operations involved in Aries protocols. Includes implementations for Indy & Cheqd ledgers (i.e. resolving anoncreds objects), Askar wallets, and anoncreds-rs.
              * `messages` - well-typed library for building and parsing Aries (DIDComm V1) messages
              * `aries_vcx` - Implementation of Aries protocol state machines, which provide APIs to step through Aries protocols, utilizing lots of the above-mentioned modules. Currently mostly for AIP1 protocols, but some AIP2 protocols such as DIDExchange/OOB.

Self-Certification may be considered as a Certification authority option. This project will provide a process to evolve the validation criteria based on experience and as the VN F Requirements & Guidelines evolve. At each release of ONAP, the scope of functionality tested and the test coverage for VNF validation may change. This Project will validate the VNF package integrity and provenance e.g. using signing & attestation. This Project will maintain the authoritative set of tests and test procedures for Validations of VNFs. This project shall develop the tests and test procedures traceable to the VNF Requirements & Guidelines.

              The z/OS Open Tools github organization serves as a collaborative github organization for z/OS UNIX developers, users, and organizations who contribute to and utilize open-source tools on z/OS.
              z/OS Open Tools started in 2022 with a handful of projects and now currently hosts over 180+ projects, with the aim of providing the build recipes as well as the patches to enable popular open source packages to build and run on z/OS. z/OS Open Tools includes ports for popular open source projects like Git, Bash, Curl, CMake, Make, GPG, LLama.cpp, Vim, Nano and many more.
              z/OS Open Tools also distributes binaries for each of the tools as Github releases. It also provides a z/OS UNIX package manager (zopen) that makes it easy to consume the 180+ tools directly on z/OS.

              Cloudbase Solutions is dedicated to interoperability and cloud computing. Unlike most companies which tend to focus on very limited technological options, we believe in the opportunities given by interaction between heterogeneous systems.

              Our involvement in the OpenStack community and the development of the Hyper-V compute driver are a natural result of our experience on multiple environments, ranging from Microsoft infrastructures to Linux and BSD.

              We believe that a very large number of companies will benefit by bringing OpenStack to the Windows world. This is something that applies to hypervisors, guests operating systems, protocol interoperability, identity management, relational and non relational data and so on.

              We are also involved in developing tools to bridge OpenStack with Azure, easing the transition from private to public cloud, a task that until now required complicated and error prone solutions.

              Cloudbase Solutions is entirely self-funded with offices in Romania (Timisoara and Iasi) and soon in North America as well.

              About us
              Since its foundation, the mission of Cloud&Heat Technologies has been to make sustainability a driver of digital innovation. The Dresden-based company develops, builds and operates energy-efficient, scalable and secure data centres that meet the requirements of the future cloud.

              Private and public cloud solutions based on OpenStack are offered both as customised solutions for SMEs, such as the company’s Datacenter in a Box (DiaB) and Datacenter Container (DCC) products, as well as in the form of technology solutions for larger IT infrastructure players. Both business areas use Cloud&Heat’s innovative hot water direct cooling, which is highly efficient but also enables the re-use of the waste heat; water at a constant temperature of 60 degrees connects directly to building or district heating systems. Thereby, Cloud&Heat builds and operates the world's most energy- and cost-efficient data centres.

              The company already received numerous awards and counts some of the world’s leading corporations from Europe, Asia, and the US among its customers. Cloud&Heat is also actively defining the future of cloud computing through its participation in a number of consortia, such as AUDITOR and SecuStack.

              CLYSO is defined by its solid structure, focused drive, and service-oriented culture. With 39 employees in Germany and 8 in North America, we specialize almost exclusively in Ceph. Over 18 of our developers are dedicated solely to building and optimizing Ceph solutions, ensuring you partner with a team that understands the technology from the ground up.

When you work with us, you work with a partner that not only stays up-to-date but also drives development. Our continuous contributions to bug fixing and code development directly benefit the stability and security of the solutions we implement.

              We specialize in designing, deploying, and operating highly resilient, large-scale infrastructures across Private Cloud, Public Cloud, and Multi Cloud domains. Our engineering capabilities encompass integration of Software Defined Storage using Ceph, automated lifecycle management via Kubernetes and Openstack, and the orchestration of IaaS and PaaS platforms tailored for complex enterprise workloads. Leveraging deep expertise in Linux and OpenSource Technologies, our team applies advanced optimization, security hardening, and cost management strategies to deliver scalable, high-performance environments. By adopting infrastructure-as-code, advanced monitoring, and multi-tenant architectures, we accelerate cloud transformation projects—empowering organizations to achieve operational agility, efficiency, and future-ready cloud ecosystems.

Fannie Mae operates in the U.S. secondary mortgage market. Rather than making home loans directly to consumers, they work with mortgage bankers, brokers and other primary mortgage market partners to help ensure they have funds to lend to home buyers at affordable rates. Fannie Mae funds mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets. Fannie Mae has three lines of business - Single-Family, Multifamily and Capital Markets - that provide services and products to lenders and a broad range of housing partners. Together, these businesses contribute to the company's chartered mission to increase the amount of funds available in order to make home ownership and rental housing more available and affordable.

              HP Inc. (also known as HP and stylized as hp) is an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California, United States. It develops personal computers (PCs), printers and related supplies, as well as 3D printing solutions.

              It was formed on November 1, 2015, renamed from the personal computer and printer divisions of the original Hewlett-Packard Company, with its enterprise products and services businesses becoming Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's pre-2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.[2][3]

              HP is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the S&P 500 Index.

              Company History

              Meinberg was founded in 1979 by Werner and G��__nter Meinberg, and today represents a successful high technology company. More than 60 employees are passionately involved in the development and manufacture of electronic devices and systems for time and frequency synchronization and distribution.



              Meinberg offers a broad spectrum of GPS receivers, WWVB, DCF77(PZF) and MSF radio clocks, bus-level timing cards, and associated accessories. The components and modules installed in our standard models are basic functional blocks which can be re-combined in complex systems to address the specific requirements of our customers. Our popular LANTIME NTP Time Servers are an example of our innovative product management, which is focused on the growing field of network technology.



              All products offered by Meinberg are developed and manufactured in our plant located in Bad Pyrmont, Germany. Our engineers maintain responsibility for our products from initial concept through production and aftermarket support. Highly specialized personnel staff our sales, production, test, and shipping departments.



              Modern production machinery and test systems guarantee a consistently high level of quality in all our products. Meinberg's objective is complete customer satisfaction with our products and services, and we strive to provide the highest level of quality, technical innovation, and flexibility in all our products.







              Quality and Service



                Our Products

              We manufacture all our electronic modules and sub-assemblies in our own plant in Bad Pyrmont, Germany. Our circuit boards are built on our own SMD insertion machines, using the latest lead-free soldering technology and highest quality components. Our manufacturing procedures are carefully documented and controlled, and our products are carefully inspected at each production step. Extensive functional testing includes a lengthy power-on burn-in in special cabinets that monitor and record the performance of each assembly. We do everything we can to insure that the product you receive is built to last and functions perfectly for years to come.

              HISTORY



              Wargaming was founded as a privately held company in 1998 by a group of military strategy enthusiasts. Through the development of many strategy-based games since the company��_��_s inception, the team has applied its many learnings to launch the highly successful World of Tanks, to be followed by the much anticipated World of Warplanes and World of Warships.



              1998: Wargaming launched its first commercial game ��_��_��_ DBA Online. Featuring a combination of tactical and strategic gameplay set in medieval times, the turn-based strategy game quickly developed an intensive thriving online community of miniature war gamers and devoted fans.



              2003: Wargaming further solidified its reputation as a premier turn-based strategy game developer wih the release of Massive Assault. Set in a futuristic sci-fi world, Massive Assault was praised by game critics for its engrossing strategic gameplay and stunning visuals. The game won numerous awards including Best Strategy Game of the Year award from Absolute Games.



              2004: Wargaming brought the franchise into the global online arena with the release of Massive Assault Network, designed specifically for strategy gamers looking to take their gameplay experience online. The title soon evolved into a series with the launch of Massive Assault: Phantom Renaissance and Massive Assault Network 2, both released in 2006.



              2006: Wargaming released Galactic Assault: Prisoner of Power, a turn-based strategy based on the iconic science fiction universe created by the acclaimed Russian writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Galactic Assault offered players a revolutionary tactical combat system with more than 70 unique combat units and cutting edge visuals.



              2007: Wargaming continued to grow as a company and in November carried out a merger with Arise, an independent PC game developer. The merger helped solidify Wargaming��_��_s position as one of the leading strategy and RPG developers in the world. 2007 also marked the company��_��_s evolution from turn-based to real-time strategy game development.



              2008: Wargaming released Operation: Bagration, a real-time strategy game set in 1944 and based on historically accurate war-time clashes in Eastern Europe. Developed using a proprietary in-house 3D engine, Operation: Bagration received acclaim from the media for its expertly crafted and balanced gameplay and stunning visuals. The game would also go on to win Best Strategy Game of the Year at the Russian game developers conference KRI 2008.



              2009: Order of War and Order of War: Challenge both released this year, enabling Wargaming to continue to grow and evolve as a premier developer, offering players improved graphics and deeper strategic gameplay.Wargaming was the recipient of both the Best Developer and Media awards at KRI 2009.



              2010: With the strategy genre conquered, Wargaming set its sights on the yet unknown realm of free-to-play MMOs. The next project, the armored MMO action game World of Tanks, took the genre by storm, offering a combination of simple controls, a unique setting and deep tactical and strategic gameplay. The release of World of Tanks almost marked Wargaming��_��_s transition into a fully independent publisher, in addition to its development capabilities.



              While initially developed as a niche project aimed at military enthusiasts and history buffs, World of Tanks has become a global phenomenon after its initial release in Russia in 2010. The game was awarded the Best MMO award at KRI 2010, and Wargaming received the Best Developer award for a second year in a row.



              World of Tanks has also been recognized by the Guinness Book of Records before its Western launch in April of 2011, receiving recognition for having the most online concurrent users with 90,311 people playing simultaneously on one game server. This number today has topped 500,000 players.



              2011: Wargaming continued its success with World of Tanks with acclaimed presence at such notable industry events such as E3 and Gamescom, garnering an impressive list of awards and nominations and solidifying the game��_��_s claim as one of the best free-to-play MMOs. The game��_��_s growth had been staggering, with more than 20 million players worldwide. The company soon announced two new free-to-play MMO projects��_��_��_World of Warplanes and World of Battleships (later renamed to World of Warships)��_��_��_developed by Wargaming��_��_s new strategic partners, Kyiv-based Persha Studia and Lesta Studio from St. Petersburg, respectively.



              To support and operate the three projects, Wargaming opened a European branch to manage the company��_��_s public and business relations in Europe, as well as expanded its presence to the United States with a new office in the San Francisco bay area.



              2012: Wargaming saw further expansion as it entered the Korean online game market with an office opening in Seoul, South Korea, as well as increased its presence in South-East Asia through its new partner SEA Gaming. In May, the company signed a strategic partnership with Kong Jong that ensured a strong Wargaming presence in the Chinese market.



              Recently the company acquired Australian-based online-game software maker BigWorld that consolidated Wargaming's position as a leading publisher in the free-to-play market.



              Today, Wargaming has 45 million registered players with World of Tanks, and hundreds of thousands of alpha test pilots in World of Warplanes. Wargaming has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a tiny group of strategy game enthusiasts to a global company with offices in several countries and over 1200 employees worldwide. The company��_��_s three titles, World of Tanks, World of Warplanes and World of Warships, will soon be unified under one gaming service and provide the ultimate gaming experience for war gamers around the world.

              About us
              The American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) is a member-owned, non-profit national insurance advisory organization that provides specialized services to property/casualty insurers.

              More than 700 P/C insurers of all sizes throughout the U.S. use policy forms and/or rating information provided under more than 34 AAIS programs of personal, commercial, agricultural, and inland marine insurers.

              Long-known for its industry-leading inland marine and commercial output programs, AAIS in recent years has set new standards for innovation in agricultural property and liability coverage, and led the way in introducing the first advisory organization plan for rating homeowners policies by peril.

              In addition, AAIS is one of two licensed statistical agents operating nationally that collects P/C statistical information for meeting regulatory requirements and for developing loss costs for use in rating policies.

              In 2013, AAIS made a substantial new departure by launching its "Underwriting Platform,"​ a cloud-based application for underwriting and rating policies and capturing information during the quote process. "UP"​ has been developed to support AAIS's industry-leading Commercial Output Program and key classes of its Inland Marine Guide. In coming months and years, it will be deployed to support all AAIS programs.

              AAIS was created in the mid-1970s as the successor organization to a former inland marine rating bureau and continues to operate under a commitment to preserve competition in bureau services for P/C carriers.

              AAIS is currently led by Edmund J. Kelly, president and CEO, who came to AAIS in 2012 after years of experience in organizations that provided professional liability and property catastrophe insurance.

              AlmaLinux OS is an enterprise Linux (EL) operating system used across the globe by people and organizations that need a stable operating system in the EL ecosystem that's free and doesn't require a commercial license agreement. This includes everything from non-profit organizations to Fortune 500 companies, from hobbyists managing their home automation to professionals managing supercomputers that are expanding our understanding of the universe - and everything in between. 

              As the first downstream RHEL-compatible operating system to be released after the announcement that support for CentOS Linux was ending, our goal is to provide a stable, long-term option for anyone who has historically used CentOS Linux, and for whom CentOS Stream is not an option. 

              The AlmaLinux OS Foundation is a 501(c)(6) non-profit entity created as the central collaboration point for everything to do with AlmaLinux, and for the benefit of the AlmaLinux OS community.

              Overview
              Elering is an electricity and gas transmission system operator with the task of connecting the producers, various network operators and consumers who make up the system into a unified whole. An operating integral system is important also for end consumers, as it enables ensuring to consumers a high-quality energy supply with reasonable costs. This is a major objective of Elering. 

              The electricity transmission network comprises approximately 5,500 kilometres of transmission lines and 150 substations. The Estonian electricity system is connected via cross-border lines to Finland, Latvia and Russia. 

              The gas transmission network is made up of an almost 900-kilometre-long gas pipeline, three gas metering stations and almost 40 gas distribution stations. The Estonian gas network is currently connected to the Latvian and Russian gas systems. In the next few years, the Estonia-Finland gas interconnection Balticconnector will be completed, which will unify the gas networks and markets of the three Baltic states and Finland.

              Overview
              The Energy Foundation’s nonprofit mission is to serve the public interest by building a strong, clean energy economy. Pragmatic and nonpartisan, the foundation supports education and analysis to promote policy solutions that build markets for clean energy technology. Advancing renewable energy and energy efficiency can open doors to greater innovation and productivity—growing the economy with dramatically less pollution.

              A partnership of leading foundations launched the Energy Foundation in 1991               and Energy Foundation China in 1999. In the U.S., the Public Engagement Program builds broad national and state support for strong climate and clean energy policy goals pursued by the Buildings, Transportation, Power, and Climate programs.

              For nearly 25 years we have supported grantees to help educate business and community leaders, policymakers, and the general public about the health and economic benefits of a clean energy economy. Grantees include policy leaders, business, health, labor, environmental, faith, and consumer groups, as well as military organizations, think tanks, and universities.

              A thriving clean energy industry will strengthen national security, offer workers good jobs in viable industries, and keep our air and water clean and healthy—for today’s children and future generations.

              The foundation’s headquarters are in San Francisco, CA, with satellite locations in Raleigh, NC, and Chicago, IL. Energy Foundation China offices are located in Beijing, China.

              Overview
              The ETC Cooperative (the “ECC”) was created to financially support the growth and development of Ethereum Classic by funding three key aspects of the ETC ecosystem: development, marketing, and community.

              Aid development by filling in gaps where projects are out of scope for our development teams and providing funding to projects that community members want to create.

              Improve marketing by communicating ETC’s message and helping newcomers understand the strengths of ETC’s open and decentralized nature.

              Foster community by making sure the various resources the community uses are well stewarded; this includes websites, social media, forums, and documentation.

            description: |-
              With over 200 leading member companies, including 130 service providers, The MEF is a California, USA registered 501 c (3) industry association that is the enabling force for the development and implementation of agile, assured and orchestrated Third Network services for the digital economy and the hyper-connected world. Third Network services are delivered over automated, virtualized, and interconnected networks globally powered by Carrier Ethernet 2.0 (CE 2.0), Lifecycle Service Orchestration (LSO), SDN, and NFV.

              CE 2.0 is MEF��_��_s globally adopted services framework and the foundation for new services innovation. The current annual market for Carrier Ethernet products and services is approximately $80B.

              The MEF is also facilitating industry neutral implementation environments for service orchestration (OpenLSO) and L2-L7 connectivity services (OpenCS) based on Open Source, SDN and NFV, as well as current commercial PNF products.

              MEF��_��_s Certification Programs, established for over 10 years have led to certification of compliance with MEF standards by the majority of the industry��_��_s leading companies within the MEF membership.

              Beyond certification, MEF provides a broad range of marketing capabilities that provide MEF member companies of all sizes in all geographic locations with unique, powerful and very cost-effective customer-networking and profile-raising opportunities.

              Key benefits of membership for hardware and software solution providers include:

              Advance visibility into relevant industry technical standards developments
              Ability to influence standards to align with corporate objectives
              As a key contributor, achieve thought leadership in front of MEF��_��_s 130+ SP members
              Achieve corporate and individual visibility and recognition via participation in MEF Marketing activities (e.g. webinars and seminars)
              Leverage the MEF global community of peer contacts 
              Get your products certified
              MEF members include Tier 1,2 and 3 service providers (approx.130), hardware and OSS/orchestration software providers, test labs and test equipment and test software providers. In 2016 and 2017, considerable growth from SDN and NFV technology providers is expected as our work increasingly leverages these technologies.

              Membership is geographically dispersed with approximately 50% from North America, 23% APAC, 21% EMEA and 6% CALA. Africa and CALA will lead the regional growth as emerging markets move to interconnect with the global community using standardized CE 2.0 services.

              The MEF membership meets quarterly and, between meetings, projects are progressed via a collaborative wiki workspace and online meetings (MEF provisions GoTo Meeting for all projects). Quarterly meetings take place in January, April, July/August and October each year. They are 4 days in duration and take place in North America (x3) and Europe (x1) with typically 150-250 people attending - including leading subject matter experts.

              Not only are these very important meetings for influencing MEF work, but also for networking informally with industry thought leaders, subject matter experts in all fields and customers (actual or potential) during our cocktail receptions, corridor meetings and evening dinners. https://www.mef.net/news-events/mef-quarterly-meetings

              There is a single category of membership ��_��_��_ Principal company membership with an annual fee of $17,250. There are no charges for quarterly meetings or LSO Hackathon participation. There is no limit on the number of participating individuals for a given member company.

              See www.mef.net for more information and www.mef16.net for more information on MEF��_��_s flagship MEF16 conference

            description: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. It is often cited as among the world's top universities. The "Engineers" sponsor 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.

            description: Since 2014, Open Culture Foundation has functioned as a legal entity and supported over 30 open technology communities in Taiwan. Throughout this process, we have not only continued to promote the idea of open technology, we have also become involved in policy advocacy and spoken up for the public's digital rights. Through this process, we have created a base for the development of open technology in Taiwan. None of these successes are the result of OCF alone. Rather, they are the result of several open tech communities, individuals and organizations working together to make Taiwan's internet and digital environment more open, transparent, and participatory.

              OpenIPC is an open source operating system from the open community targeting for IP cameras with ARM and MIPS processors from several manufacturers in order to replace that closed, opaque, insecure, often abandoned and unsupported firmware pre-installed by a vendor.

              OpenIPC firmware comes as binary pre-compiled files for easy installation by end-user. Also, we provide full access to the source files for further development and improvement by any capable programmer willing to contribute to the project. OpenIPC source code is released under one of the most simple open source license agreements, MIT License, giving users express permission to reuse code for any purpose, even as part of a proprietary software. We only ask you politely to contribute your improvements back to us and also be sure to contact us if you use our project for commercial purposes. We would be grateful for any feedback and suggestions. The use of the OpenIPC project and its components for military purposes is not permitted.

It was named in honor of shipping and rail magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, who provided the school its initial $1 million endowment despite having never been to the South. Vanderbilt hoped that his gift and the greater work of the university would help to heal the sectional wounds inflicted by the Civil War. Today, Vanderbilt enrolls approximately 12,000 students from all 50 U.S. states and over 90 foreign countries in four undergraduate and six graduate and professional schools. Several research centers and institutes are affiliated with the university, including the Vanderbilt Institute for Public Policy Studies, Freedom Forum First Amendment Center, Dyer Observatory, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the only Level I trauma center in Middle Tennessee. With the exception of the off-campus observatory and satellite medical clinics, all of the university's facilities are situated on its 330-acre (1.3 km2) campus in the heart of Nashville, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from downtown
