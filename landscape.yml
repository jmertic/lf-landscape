              Aeraki Mesh allows you to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.
              While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure for microservices, many service mesh implementations mainly focus on HTTP protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. This makes it very hard for users to manage the traffic of other widely-used layer-7 protocols in microservices. For example, in a microservices application, we usually have the below protocols:
                * RPC: HTTP, gRPC, Thrift, Dubbo, Proprietary RPC Protocol …
                * Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ …
                * Cache: Redis, Memcached …
                * Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB …
              HTTP is just a part of the problem we need to solve. Aeraki Mesh is created to provide a non-intrusive, highly extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.

              Aeraki Mesh is an open source project backed by Tencent Cloud (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tencent-cloud),  contributed and used by a number of companies/projects inside and outside of Tencent, suh QQ music, Yangshiping, Yonghui Super Marke, etc. (https://www.aeraki.net/). Tencent Cloud  is committed to continue working on Aeraki Mesh going forward, and plans to provide managed Aeraki Mesh service on the cloud.

              An operator simply applies an Akri Configuration to a cluster, specifying the Discovery Handler (most commonly a protocol) that should be used to discover the devices, and the pod that should be deployed upon discovery. Then Akri does the rest.

              An operator can also allow multiple nodes to use an IoT device, thereby providing high availability in the case where a node goes offline. Furthermore, Akri will automatically create a Kubernetes service for each type of device, removing the need for an application to track the state of pods or nodes."

              Since eBPF is gaining in popularity, we are building tools that make it easier for developers and operations teams to securely deploy and manage eBPF programs in various environments.

              bpfman is a suite of eBPF program management tooling that includes:
                - A system service for loading and managing eBPF programs
                - An opentelemetry metrics exporter for the kernel eBPF subsystem
                - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and a Kubernetes Controller that extend our loading and management capabilities to Kubernetes.
                - A Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin that can provision BPF filesystems.

              This suite is available as binaries or RPMs for Linux, and packaged as an Operator for Kubernetes.

              Carina is a cloud native storage system which conforms standard Kubernetes CSI spec and  provides raw disk performance for stateful applications and has ops-free maintaining. The core function of Carina is grouping local disks of each node and provides LVM or RAW disks via different storage classes. For each PVC, Carina tries to find the most suitable node to setup data volume. Carina also has lots of useful features, for example:

              * device registration
              * PVC resizing
              * IO throttling
              * volume topology
              * PVC auto-tiering
              * pod failover to other nodes
              * RAID management
              * SMART-aware PVC

              Besides of rich functionalities, Carina also is an ops-free CSI, for example:

              * Installation by yaml or helm. No dependencies for each node.
              * Using battle-tested kernel modules and sits beside of the core IO path. 
              * If disk fails, just plugin a new one and that's done."

              Implement a limited number of RIs that address CNTT reference architectures to meet operators’ requirements. Limit the number of RI to ensure limiting the VNF verification effort
              Develop test-cases for testing RI.  These test cases could be used by the compliance program for verification and compliance.
              Work with LF Compliance and Verification Committee (CVC) to integrate RI, test cases and test frameworks within OVP compliance Framework.

              seeks to publish and maintain curated exemplars of the data sets used in our industry. Research projects and commercial development projects often have trouble obtaining
              input datasets with full film complexity, and that are licensed to allow publishing research results and software demonstrations. Disney’s Moana Island is a prime example
              of what we want to encourage, but in addition to 3D scene data, assets could also be images, image sequences, volumetric data, animation rigs, edit decision lists, etc.

              Grid eXchange Fabric (GXF) is a software platform that enables hardware monitoring and control in the public space. GXF provides several functions out of the box and provides scalability & high availability, high security, a generic design, and no vendor lock-in. GXF is currently deployed in several public use cases, including microgrids, smart metering, public lighting, and distribution automation.

              GXF is open, independent, and driven by its community, developed using open source best practices and designed to use open standards. This enables third parties to develop new and innovative solutions. The trade-off is flexibility and freedom. Unlike closed proprietary software, open source software can be altered and extended by any developer familiar with the source code. This grants organizations freedom from “vendor lock-in,” assures long-term viability, and creates industry opportunities for support, consulting, and training.

              Hyperlight is a library for creating micro virtual machines — or sandboxes — specifically optimized for securely running untrusted code with minimal impact. It supports both Windows and Linux, utilizing Windows Hypervisor Platform on Windows, and either Microsoft Hypervisor (mshv) or KVM on Linux.

              These micro VMs operate without a kernel or operating system, keeping overhead low. Instead, guests are built specifically for Hyperlight using the Hyperlight Guest library, which provides a controlled set of APIs that facilitate interaction between host and guest:

              The host can call functions implemented and exposed by the guest (known as guest functions).
              Once running, the guest can call functions implemented and exposed by the host (known as host functions).
              By default, Hyperlight restricts guest access to a minimal API. The only host function available by default allows the guest to print messages, which are displayed on the host console or redirected to stdout, as configured. Hosts can choose to expose additional host functions, expanding the guest’s capabilities as needed.

              KEDA is a Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaler. KEDA determines how any container in Kubernetes should be scaled based on the number of events that need to be processed.

              KEDA is a single-purpose and lightweight component that can be added to any Kubernetes cluster. It works alongside standard Kubernetes components like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and can extend functionality without overwriting or duplication. With KEDA you can specify the that apps you want to scale in an event-driven way while other apps continue to function. This makes KEDA a flexible and safe option to run alongside other Kubernetes applications and frameworks.

              Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter) uses eBPF to probe CPU performance counters and Linux kernel tracepoints. These data and stats from cgroup and sysfs are fed into ML models to estimate power consumption by Pods. The power consumption stats are then presented as Prometheus metrics and telemetry that can be used for Pod scheduling or scaling, energy consumption reporting and visulization, or can be extended with carbon intensity metrics to report on carbon footprint of Cloud Native workload.

              1. Assess and analyze applications to determine which modernization strategy to utilize (rehost, replatform, or refactor). 
              2. Automate the rehosting, replatforming, and refactoring of applications.
              3. Measure the impact of modernization on software delivery performance.

              Kubescape is an open-source tool for testing if Kubernetes is deployed securely according to multiple frameworks: regulatory, customized company policies and DevSecOps best practices, such as the NSA-CISA hardening guidance and the MITRE ATT&CK® .

              Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, and detect misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline and provides a risk score instantly and risk trends over time. Kubescape integrates natively with other DevOps tools, including Jenkins, CircleCI and Github workflows. Kubescape policies are based on Open Policy Agent and the REGO language. 

              A key idea behind Kubescape it to put security capabilities at the hands of the Developers and the DevOps teams. Our vision is to create a wide open-source Kubernetes security project with capabilities that will span across configuration control, vulnerabilities, RBAC management and runtime security - all made for developers and DevOps to add to their tools in a native way.

              Merbridge uses eBPF to intercept outbound and inbound traffic and provides a feedback mechanism to enable eBPF to get the IP address of current namespace and redirect the Envoy connection to a pre-defined port. After applying Merbridge, the outbound/inbound traffic can skip many filter steps to effectively improve network performance.
              With Merbridge, developers can use eBPF to accelerate the Mesh without any additional operations or code changes."

              A nonprofit alliance founded by the Building Decarbonization Coalition, Rewiring America, and Eli Technologies, the National Open Data for Electrification (NODE) Collective will source, structure, and maintain data on every incentive program in the nation, and make it open and accessible to all who are committed to furthering the goal of building decarbonization. The NODE Collective has already amassed the most complete, well-structured, and accurate set of incentive data in the U.S. It has developed the tools to enlist a broad coalition in this effort moving forward.

              The Challenge: Fragmented and outdated electrification incentive data are major barriers to progress in the electrification

              Our Solution: NODE Collective introduces a vibrant, evolving data repository, a cornerstone of reliable and up-to-date electrification information, energized by:

              Proactive Data Collection: dedicated submission channels enable us to actively gather up-to-date and precise incentive data.

              Collaborative Updates: A network of stakeholders collaborating to maintain data accuracy and consistency, underpinned by structured protocols and expert review.

              Standardization of Incentive Data: By creating clear formats and guidelines, NODE Collective eliminates inconsistencies, facilitating streamlined data exchange.

              The Foundation for Impact:
              NODE Collective's data repository will set the gold standard for tracking electrification incentives, laying a solid foundation for informed decisions, innovative tools, and insightful policy development.

              the open-source Kubernetes container management system as a means to manage the Docker containers that compose ONAP where the containers are hosted either directly on bare-metal
              servers or on VMs hosted by a 3rd party management system. OOM ensures that ONAP is easily deployable and maintainable throughout its life cycle while using hardware resources
              efficiently.

              OpenCost is an open source cost allocation model that provides visibility into current and historical Kubernetes workload spend and resource consumption. This provides cost transparency in containerized environments with multiple tenants and allows teams to view costs across all aggregation-levels, including namespace, label, and controller all the way down to the individual pod and container. Organizations can provide unified cost monitoring, showback, real-time alerting, chargeback and more across projects and teams with this visibility. This project is the core engine for Kubecost, which is used by thousands of enterprises to monitor billions of total spend in environments with 10,000+ nodes.

              - Summary of features enabled by this cost model:
              - Real-time cost allocation by Kubernetes service, deployment, namespace, label, statefulset, daemonset, pod, and container
              - Dynamic asset pricing enabled by integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP billing APIs
              - Supports on-prem k8s clusters with custom pricing sheets
              - Allocation for in-cluster resources like CPU, GPU, memory, load balancers, network costs, and persistent volumes.
              - Easily export pricing data to Prometheus and Alertmanager (learn more)

            description: |-
              The Open Policy Registry (OPCR) project contains a CLI (policy) for building, tagging, pushing, and pulling OPA policies as OCIv2 images. The policy CLI defaults to pushing and pulling from opcr.io, a free hosted registry that is optimized around listing and handling policy images. With that said, the policy CLI works with any OCIv2-compatible registry, such as GitHub Container Registry, Google Artifact Registry, AWS Container Registry, etc. 

              The ecosystem benefits of using the policy CLI are that policies can now be built into immutable images, signed using cosign, and pushed and pulled from container registries - in other words, the benefits of the OCIv2 ecosystem are now conferred to OPA policies.

              The policy CLI workflow is modeled after the docker CLI - with the ability to build images locally (""policy build""), tag them (""policy tag""), list them (""policy images""), pull them (""policy pull""), and push them (""policy push""). This brings the familiar workflow to the OPA policies.

              without having to build Yet Another Storage Solution (YASS). ORAS consists of both a CLI (https://oras.land/#oras-cli) for initial testing and a Go Module (https://oras.land/#oras-go-module)
              to be included with your CLI. The ORAS project will include additional language libraries so any artifact author, with any language can benefit.

              Paralus grants authorized users seamless and secure access to all clusters with a native and familiar kubectl experience by acting as a proxy between the users and systems needing access and the K8s API server. It also addresses one of K8s’ main pain points by eliminating the burden of managing K8s access controls cluster by cluster. Without Paralus, companies must manually manage access to each cluster using jump hosts or VPNs, and build custom tooling to audit and map all actions performed to a user’s identity – all of which is error-prone and increases the risk of breaches as the number of clusters grows.


              Along with helping directly manage role-based access control (RBAC) policies and assignments, Paralus enables:

              - Creation of custom roles, users, and groups.
              - Custom user role creation and revoking of permissions.
              - Ability to control access via pre-configured roles across clusters, namespaces, projects, and more.
              - Seamless integration with Identity Providers (IdPs) allowing the use of external authentication engines for users and group definitions, such as GitHub, Google, Azure AD, Okta, and others.
              - Automatic logging of all user actions performed for audit and compliance purposes.
              - Interact with Paralus either with a modern web GUI (default), a CLI tool called pctl, or Paralus API.

              The idea of PipeCD is to make a unified interface to deploy different kinds of applications (currently PipeCD supports Kubernetes, Terraform, GCP Cloud Run, AWS Lambda, and AWS ECS). The reason behind that idea is we are faced with systems that mix multiple platforms running applications, and also at the company scale, not every team has the same idea/experience/taste when choosing the team stack (CD included), and all gaps and diversity between teams’ decisions should be respected and treated carefully.

              PowSyBl (Power System Blocks) is an open source library dedicated to electrical grid modeling and simulation. PowSyBl is written in Java and licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

              PowSyBl may be scripted for a quick solution, but it can also be used as a library to write complex software for power system simulation and analysis. Using PowSyBl, developers can create applications able to perform dynamic power flow simulations and security analyses on the network, handle a variety of formats including CGMES for European data exchanges, and many other tasks.

              PowSyBl has a completely modular design, enabling developers to extend or customize its features by providing their own plugins. Modularity is a key value of PowSyBl’s open source design.

              encrypted shares and upload each share to different data share processors that do not share data with each other. This way only minimal information about the original data
              is revealed to either processor. Each processor then aggregates its data shares into a partial sum. The partial sums can then be combined into a final aggregation, permitting
              useful statistics over the whole body of data while revealing minimal information about individual participants.

              SlimToolkit (aka DockerSlim) provides a way to inspect, optimize/slim and debug containers

              SlimToolkit/Slim is best know for its ability to minify container images. It was created during a global Docker hackathon project (as DockerSlim). It uses static and dynamic container analysis to understand the containerized application and what it needs to run, so it can generate the smallest possible container images. The lesser known capabilities include the xray command used to inspect container images and the debug command used to debug minimal container images by attaching a debugging container to the target container.

              Cloudbase Solutions is dedicated to interoperability and cloud computing. Unlike most companies which tend to focus on very limited technological options, we believe in the opportunities given by interaction between heterogeneous systems.

              Our involvement in the OpenStack community and the development of the Hyper-V compute driver are a natural result of our experience on multiple environments, ranging from Microsoft infrastructures to Linux and BSD.

              We believe that a very large number of companies will benefit by bringing OpenStack to the Windows world. This is something that applies to hypervisors, guests operating systems, protocol interoperability, identity management, relational and non relational data and so on.

              We are also involved in developing tools to bridge OpenStack with Azure, easing the transition from private to public cloud, a task that until now required complicated and error prone solutions.

              Cloudbase Solutions is entirely self-funded with offices in Romania (Timisoara and Iasi) and soon in North America as well.

              It was formed on November 1, 2015, renamed from the personal computer and printer divisions of the original Hewlett-Packard Company, with its enterprise products and services businesses becoming Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's pre-2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.[2][3]

              HP is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the S&P 500 Index.

More than 60 employees are passionately involved in the development and manufacture of electronic devices and systems for time and frequency synchronization and distribution.



              Meinberg offers a broad spectrum of GPS receivers, WWVB, DCF77(PZF) and MSF radio clocks, bus-level timing cards, and associated accessories. The components and modules installed in our standard models are basic functional blocks which can be re-combined in complex systems to address the specific requirements of our customers. Our popular LANTIME NTP Time Servers are an example of our innovative product management, which is focused on the growing field of network technology.



              All products offered by Meinberg are developed and manufactured in our plant located in Bad Pyrmont, Germany. Our engineers maintain responsibility for our products from initial concept through production and aftermarket support. Highly specialized personnel staff our sales, production, test, and shipping departments.

                Our Products

              We manufacture all our electronic modules and sub-assemblies in our own plant in Bad Pyrmont, Germany. Our circuit boards are built on our own SMD insertion machines, using the latest lead-free soldering technology and highest quality components. Our manufacturing procedures are carefully documented and controlled, and our products are carefully inspected at each production step. Extensive functional testing includes a lengthy power-on burn-in in special cabinets that monitor and record the performance of each assembly. We do everything we can to insure that the product you receive is built to last and functions perfectly for years to come.

              Orange is one of the world’s leading telecommunications operators with revenues of 39.7 billion euros in 2023 and 128,000 employees worldwide at 30 June 2024, including 72,000 employees in France. The Group has a total customer base of 285 million customers worldwide at 30 June 2024, including 246 million mobile customers and 21 million fixed broadband customers. These figures have been restated to account for the deconsolidation of certain activities in Spain following the creation of MASORANGE. The Group is present in 26 countries (including non-consolidated countries).
              Orange is also a leading provider of global IT and telecommunication services to multinational companies under the brand Orange Business. In February 2023, the Group presented its strategic plan 'Lead the Future', built on a new business model and guided by responsibility and efficiency. 'Lead the Future' capitalizes on network excellence to reinforce Orange's leadership in service quality.
              Orange is listed on Euronext Paris (symbol ORA) and on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol ORAN).

              2015: Dear Kevlin

              As we actually only focus on the Swiss market, a sponsorship for any

              international event is quite too big for us.



              Should we plan to expand internationally, we will reconsider your

              offer and the events from the Linux Foundation.

              Kind regards,

              HISTORY



              Wargaming was founded as a privately held company in 1998 by a group of military strategy enthusiasts. Through the development of many strategy-based games since the company��_��_s inception, the team has applied its many learnings to launch the highly successful World of Tanks, to be followed by the much anticipated World of Warplanes and World of Warships.



              1998: Wargaming launched its first commercial game ��_��_��_ DBA Online. Featuring a combination of tactical and strategic gameplay set in medieval times, the turn-based strategy game quickly developed an intensive thriving online community of miniature war gamers and devoted fans.



              2003: Wargaming further solidified its reputation as a premier turn-based strategy game developer wih the release of Massive Assault. Set in a futuristic sci-fi world, Massive Assault was praised by game critics for its engrossing strategic gameplay and stunning visuals. The game won numerous awards including Best Strategy Game of the Year award from Absolute Games.



              2004: Wargaming brought the franchise into the global online arena with the release of Massive Assault Network, designed specifically for strategy gamers looking to take their gameplay experience online. The title soon evolved into a series with the launch of Massive Assault: Phantom Renaissance and Massive Assault Network 2, both released in 2006.



              2006: Wargaming released Galactic Assault: Prisoner of Power, a turn-based strategy based on the iconic science fiction universe created by the acclaimed Russian writers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Galactic Assault offered players a revolutionary tactical combat system with more than 70 unique combat units and cutting edge visuals.



              2007: Wargaming continued to grow as a company and in November carried out a merger with Arise, an independent PC game developer. The merger helped solidify Wargaming��_��_s position as one of the leading strategy and RPG developers in the world. 2007 also marked the company��_��_s evolution from turn-based to real-time strategy game development.



              2008: Wargaming released Operation: Bagration, a real-time strategy game set in 1944 and based on historically accurate war-time clashes in Eastern Europe. Developed using a proprietary in-house 3D engine, Operation: Bagration received acclaim from the media for its expertly crafted and balanced gameplay and stunning visuals. The game would also go on to win Best Strategy Game of the Year at the Russian game developers conference KRI 2008.



              2009: Order of War and Order of War: Challenge both released this year, enabling Wargaming to continue to grow and evolve as a premier developer, offering players improved graphics and deeper strategic gameplay.Wargaming was the recipient of both the Best Developer and Media awards at KRI 2009.



              2010: With the strategy genre conquered, Wargaming set its sights on the yet unknown realm of free-to-play MMOs. The next project, the armored MMO action game World of Tanks, took the genre by storm, offering a combination of simple controls, a unique setting and deep tactical and strategic gameplay. The release of World of Tanks almost marked Wargaming��_��_s transition into a fully independent publisher, in addition to its development capabilities.



              While initially developed as a niche project aimed at military enthusiasts and history buffs, World of Tanks has become a global phenomenon after its initial release in Russia in 2010. The game was awarded the Best MMO award at KRI 2010, and Wargaming received the Best Developer award for a second year in a row.



              World of Tanks has also been recognized by the Guinness Book of Records before its Western launch in April of 2011, receiving recognition for having the most online concurrent users with 90,311 people playing simultaneously on one game server. This number today has topped 500,000 players.



              2011: Wargaming continued its success with World of Tanks with acclaimed presence at such notable industry events such as E3 and Gamescom, garnering an impressive list of awards and nominations and solidifying the game��_��_s claim as one of the best free-to-play MMOs. The game��_��_s growth had been staggering, with more than 20 million players worldwide. The company soon announced two new free-to-play MMO projects��_��_��_World of Warplanes and World of Battleships (later renamed to World of Warships)��_��_��_developed by Wargaming��_��_s new strategic partners, Kyiv-based Persha Studia and Lesta Studio from St. Petersburg, respectively.



              To support and operate the three projects, Wargaming opened a European branch to manage the company��_��_s public and business relations in Europe, as well as expanded its presence to the United States with a new office in the San Francisco bay area.



              2012: Wargaming saw further expansion as it entered the Korean online game market with an office opening in Seoul, South Korea, as well as increased its presence in South-East Asia through its new partner SEA Gaming. In May, the company signed a strategic partnership with Kong Jong that ensured a strong Wargaming presence in the Chinese market.



              Recently the company acquired Australian-based online-game software maker BigWorld that consolidated Wargaming's position as a leading publisher in the free-to-play market.



              Today, Wargaming has 45 million registered players with World of Tanks, and hundreds of thousands of alpha test pilots in World of Warplanes. Wargaming has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a tiny group of strategy game enthusiasts to a global company with offices in several countries and over 1200 employees worldwide. The company��_��_s three titles, World of Tanks, World of Warplanes and World of Warships, will soon be unified under one gaming service and provide the ultimate gaming experience for war gamers around the world.

              About us
              The American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) is a member-owned, non-profit national insurance advisory organization that provides specialized services to property/casualty insurers.

              More than 700 P/C insurers of all sizes throughout the U.S. use policy forms and/or rating information provided under more than 34 AAIS programs of personal, commercial, agricultural, and inland marine insurers.

              Long-known for its industry-leading inland marine and commercial output programs, AAIS in recent years has set new standards for innovation in agricultural property and liability coverage, and led the way in introducing the first advisory organization plan for rating homeowners policies by peril.

              In addition, AAIS is one of two licensed statistical agents operating nationally that collects P/C statistical information for meeting regulatory requirements and for developing loss costs for use in rating policies.

              In 2013, AAIS made a substantial new departure by launching its "Underwriting Platform,"​ a cloud-based application for underwriting and rating policies and capturing information during the quote process. "UP"​ has been developed to support AAIS's industry-leading Commercial Output Program and key classes of its Inland Marine Guide. In coming months and years, it will be deployed to support all AAIS programs.

              AAIS was created in the mid-1970s as the successor organization to a former inland marine rating bureau and continues to operate under a commitment to preserve competition in bureau services for P/C carriers.

              AAIS is currently led by Edmund J. Kelly, president and CEO, who came to AAIS in 2012 after years of experience in organizations that provided professional liability and property catastrophe insurance.

              Overview
              Elering is an electricity and gas transmission system operator with the task of connecting the producers, various network operators and consumers who make up the system into a unified whole. An operating integral system is important also for end consumers, as it enables ensuring to consumers a high-quality energy supply with reasonable costs. This is a major objective of Elering. 

              The electricity transmission network comprises approximately 5,500 kilometres of transmission lines and 150 substations. The Estonian electricity system is connected via cross-border lines to Finland, Latvia and Russia. 

              The gas transmission network is made up of an almost 900-kilometre-long gas pipeline, three gas metering stations and almost 40 gas distribution stations. The Estonian gas network is currently connected to the Latvian and Russian gas systems. In the next few years, the Estonia-Finland gas interconnection Balticconnector will be completed, which will unify the gas networks and markets of the three Baltic states and Finland.

              Overview
              The Emirates College of Technology (ECT) was first established as the Emirates Institute of Technology (EIT) in early in 1993. In 1993 In the same year, the EIT was licensed by the Ministry of Education to provide training in computing, management, language and other university services in the UAE. In 1995 the EIT, in association with a number of international institutions, launched its first academic programs: a double major diploma in business administration and computer information systems. This guaranteed that the quality of the program meets international standards.

              In April 2008, the ECT acquired the initial accreditation for its third program, i.e., "double major in e-Commerce and Marketing (Double Major)"​ from the Ministry. In May 2008, the ECT obtained the initial accreditation for two more programs, i.e., a two-year diploma in Accounting and a two-year diploma in Banking and Finance from the Ministry. In July 2008, the ECT obtained the initial accreditation for its sixth program, "Computer Graphic Design and Animation"​ from the Ministry. A year later, in May 2009, the ECT obtained the initial accreditation for its seventh program, i.e., “Mass Communication and Public Relations”. In April 2011, the ECT obtained the initial accreditation for its eighth program, “Public Relations”, offered in Arabic.

              Overview
              The Energy Foundation’s nonprofit mission is to serve the public interest by building a strong, clean energy economy. Pragmatic and nonpartisan, the foundation supports education and analysis to promote policy solutions that build markets for clean energy technology. Advancing renewable energy and energy efficiency can open doors to greater innovation and productivity—growing the economy with dramatically less pollution.

              A partnership of leading foundations launched the Energy Foundation in 1991               and Energy Foundation China in 1999. In the U.S., the Public Engagement Program builds broad national and state support for strong climate and clean energy policy goals pursued by the Buildings, Transportation, Power, and Climate programs.

              For nearly 25 years we have supported grantees to help educate business and community leaders, policymakers, and the general public about the health and economic benefits of a clean energy economy. Grantees include policy leaders, business, health, labor, environmental, faith, and consumer groups, as well as military organizations, think tanks, and universities.

              A thriving clean energy industry will strengthen national security, offer workers good jobs in viable industries, and keep our air and water clean and healthy—for today’s children and future generations.

              The foundation’s headquarters are in San Francisco, CA, with satellite locations in Raleigh, NC, and Chicago, IL. Energy Foundation China offices are located in Beijing, China.

              With over 200 leading member companies, including 130 service providers, The MEF is a California, USA registered 501 c (3) industry association that is the enabling force for the development and implementation of agile, assured and orchestrated Third Network services for the digital economy and the hyper-connected world. Third Network services are delivered over automated, virtualized, and interconnected networks globally powered by Carrier Ethernet 2.0 (CE 2.0), Lifecycle Service Orchestration (LSO), SDN, and NFV.

              CE 2.0 is MEF��_��_s globally adopted services framework and the foundation for new services innovation. The current annual market for Carrier Ethernet products and services is approximately $80B.

              The MEF is also facilitating industry neutral implementation environments for service orchestration (OpenLSO) and L2-L7 connectivity services (OpenCS) based on Open Source, SDN and NFV, as well as current commercial PNF products.

              MEF��_��_s Certification Programs, established for over 10 years have led to certification of compliance with MEF standards by the majority of the industry��_��_s leading companies within the MEF membership.

              Beyond certification, MEF provides a broad range of marketing capabilities that provide MEF member companies of all sizes in all geographic locations with unique, powerful and very cost-effective customer-networking and profile-raising opportunities.

              Key benefits of membership for hardware and software solution providers include:

              Advance visibility into relevant industry technical standards developments
              Ability to influence standards to align with corporate objectives
              As a key contributor, achieve thought leadership in front of MEF��_��_s 130+ SP members

              MEF members include Tier 1,2 and 3 service providers (approx.130), hardware and OSS/orchestration software providers, test labs and test equipment and test software providers. In 2016 and 2017, considerable growth from SDN and NFV technology providers is expected as our work increasingly leverages these technologies.

              Membership is geographically dispersed with approximately 50% from North America, 23% APAC, 21% EMEA and 6% CALA. Africa and CALA will lead the regional growth as emerging markets move to interconnect with the global community using standardized CE 2.0 services.

              The MEF membership meets quarterly and, between meetings, projects are progressed via a collaborative wiki workspace and online meetings (MEF provisions GoTo Meeting for all projects). Quarterly meetings take place in January, April, July/August and October each year. They are 4 days in duration and take place in North America (x3) and Europe (x1) with typically 150-250 people attending - including leading subject matter experts.

              computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under
              James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. The Institute is
              traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well.
              It is often cited as among the world's top universities. The "Engineers" sponsor 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and
              Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.

              process, we have created a base for the development of open technology in Taiwan. None of these successes are the result of OCF alone. Rather, they are the result of several
              open tech communities, individuals and organizations working together to make Taiwan's internet and digital environment more open, transparent, and participatory.

              service to private and public bodies. Essentially the mission of ICCS was to support the deployment, the realization and the growth of the research priorities of ECE mainly
              through seeking, pursuing and acquiring research funding via the competitive calls for research proposals that the European Commission had instigated. In turn its purpose
              has been to build a research personnel base alongside ECE’s faculty so as to conduct state-of-the-art research and at the same time improve the research laboratory equipment
              base and infrastructures of the School.
